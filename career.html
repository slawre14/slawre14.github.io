        <p> 
            I had always wanted to open my own business at some point in my life. It was not until I got to college, however, that I realized how strong my passion for entrepreneurship was and how dedicated I am to creating an idea. 
        </p>
        <p> I want to become a business owner of a restaurant, or at least the dessert and bakery business. 
        </p>
        <p> I have always tried to be health conscious,and I want to create a place where people can both enjoy the food they eat without sacrificing the health factor. This year, I had the wonderful opportunity of creating a blog, 
            <a href="http://fullwithdelight.wordpress.com">Enticingly Healthy</a>, which focuses on providing healthy recipes and beneficial resources about eating healthy without sacrificing taste and satisfaction with what you eat. It has been a such a wonderful experience discovering more about myself and my passion for what I love to do- cook.
