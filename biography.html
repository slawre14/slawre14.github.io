            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <h4>Where I came from, where I am, where I want to be.</h4>
            
            <p> I am a 19 year old student at the University of Florida living in Gainesville, FL. I was born in Cairo, Egypt and moved to Miami, FL at the age of 7 along with my sister and mom. Moving to America was an extremely exciting but overwhelming process. As a little girl, I quickly learned to appreciate hard work and independence after seeing my parents provide for my sister and I while they climbed the professional ladder themselves. As I grew up, I began to adopt the work ethic that my parents have modeled for me, and I strive every day to achieve something challenging and rewarding because of it.            </p>
           <p>I am very involved at the University of Florida as an active member of Delta Sigma Pi, a national co-ed Business Fraternity, as well as American Cancer Society's Relay for Life as a committee member, and most recently elected as Vice President of Administration for the Business Administration College Council. I am also currently working for Cymplify, a local business in Gainesville, as a marketing intern. 
            </p>
            <p> I will also be studying abroad this summer in Madrid, Spain and studying at the University of Nebrija studying Spanish Culture and Literature. I hope to travel frequently while I am there and meet people from around the world and from different cultures. 
            </p>
            <p>I consider myself an optimistic person and look for the good in everything. I am passionate about motivating and mentoring others in finding their career and life interests. I hope to move into a management position for a large company upon graduation and then develop my own business. 
            </p>
